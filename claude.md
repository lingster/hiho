# Coding Practices

- Apply SOLID and DRY principles; keep business logic decoupled from IO.
- Use interfaces to enable mocks and end-to-end coverage.
- Favor small functions and files (≤300 lines).
- Write tests first when feasible; include end-to-end coverage for tmux flows.
- Keep user documentation updated when adding commands or options.
